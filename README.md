# Hex-Winner-Prediction

The Hex-Winner-Prediction project aims to predict the winner of the strategic game Hex using advanced machine learning models such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) and its extension, the Graph Tsetlin Machine (GTM).

The goal for the project was to make the system learn pattterns to perfectly predict the winner of game at three different stages: After game conclusion, two moves before the end, and five moves before the end. It was also a desire manage a 100% score on the largest possible boardsize. For this project, we managed to perfectly predict a 10x10 board.

The repository includes the best results for each stage of the challenge, as well as the file used for generating the boards. The datasets are also included, but the paths would need to be modified to work.
